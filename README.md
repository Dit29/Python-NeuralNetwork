Neural Network stubs codes for Python language.

These stubs contains standard Neural Network which has input and output (this can be modified by changing the code).

You will need to train the Neural Network model yourself.

In addition to that, the code is unoptimised. However, this repository would be great to introduce Neural Network to yourself.

The code is free-to-use
